You'll be prompted to provide some information about your app, such as the package name and keystore credentials.\n\n4.  **Download the APK:** Once the build is complete, Expo will provide you with a link to download the APK file.\n\nKeep in mind that building an APK requires an Expo account and might involve setting up credentials for the Google Play Store.\n"}], "timestamp": "2025-10-27T20:03:20Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "i have the Expo go on my android phone"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Great!
