Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   A central screen displaying \"Days Together\" prominently, along with input fields for the couple's names and a date picker for the relationship start date.\n*   Calculation and display of the number of days since the specified date.\n*   Visually appealing and intuitive navigation.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8E8EE` (Light Pink)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#E91E63` (Vivid Pink)\n    *   Secondary: `#9C27B0` (Purple)\n    *   Accent: `#FF4081` (Bright Pink)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFCDD2` (Light Red)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern and clean fonts like \"System\" for a professional yet cute feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to include:\n    *   Input fields for the couple's names.\n    *   A date picker component to select the relationship start date.\n    *   Logic to calculate the number of days between the start date and the current date.\n    *   Display the calculated number of days along with the couple's names at the top, as \"Days Together\".\n2.  Adjust the styling in `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to match the specified color palette and typography.\n3.  Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is not needed for this app.\n\nAfter you implement this plan, please remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-27T19:57:43.096763"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a cute and professional couple's day counter app!
